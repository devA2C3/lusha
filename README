Given three strings, text, prefixString, and suffixString, find:

prefixScore: the longest substring of text matching the end of prefixString
suffixScore: the longest substring of text matching the beginning of suffixString.
Sum the lengths of the two strings to get the textScore. The substring of text that begins with
the matching prefix and ends with a matching suffix, and has the highest textScore, is the
correct value to return. If there are other substrings with equal textScore, return the
lexicographically lowest substring.
